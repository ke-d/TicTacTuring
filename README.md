# TicTacTuring
## Summary
Reimplementation of Lynda.com TicTacTuring in React Native

This has some enhancements over the original TicTacTuring since it uses Graph.Cool which is a backend as a service that uses GraphQL.

Users can login and play games against an AI. Whether or not the user wins or not, the result is sent to the server and users can see the history of all their games.
